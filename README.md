# odin-etch-a-sketch

## Introduction
And here I am again, eager to continue with the Odin course.
The little hand holding this time is almost gone. It's scary, but I'll learn to research what I want to do by myself, so this is scary and exciting at the same time.

## What is it

This time I'm going to make an _etch-a-sketch_, something like the good old MS-Paint (I hope). Want to draw something in big pixels? Just wait a little until I start making magic, or open the paint application that comes with any operating system, your call, heh!
