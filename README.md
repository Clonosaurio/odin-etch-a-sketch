# odin-etch-a-sketch

## Introduction
And here I am again, eager to continue with the Odin course.
The little hand holding this time is almost gone. It's scary, but I'll learn to research what I want to do by myself, so this is scary and exciting at the same time.

## What is it

This time I'm going to make an _etch-a-sketch_, something like the good old MS-Paint (I hope). Want to draw something in big pixels? Just wait a little until I start making magic, or open the paint application that comes with any operating system, your call, heh!

### Update 1
It's working now! Still needs more work, but I managed to make it show a screen with "pixels" that change color to black once clicked. I'm surprised how I managed to do it, I barely had to search for a few DOM methods.

Now it's time to make it more interesting, I have a few more things to do to complete this exercise:
- `"mousedrag"` must be able to draw too
- color picker
- a way to clear the toy's screen
- random colors
- screen resolution (grid size)

And some personal things I want to add, but not promised:
- a filling tool
- different brush sizes and shapes
- a fake dynamic shadow using the mouse position on the window
- replacing the toy's html+css with images for better performance (too much box-shadows)
- save/load system
- zoom levels for the screen
- toggle button to change toy's visibility
