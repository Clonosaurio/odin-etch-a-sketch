# odin-etch-a-sketch

## Introduction
And here I am again, eager to continue with the Odin course.
The little hand holding this time is almost gone. It's scary, but I'll learn to research what I want to do by myself, so this is scary and exciting at the same time.

## What is it

This time I'm going to make an _etch-a-sketch_, something like the good old MS-Paint (I hope). Want to draw something in big pixels? Just wait a little until I start making magic, or open the paint application that comes with any operating system, your call, heh!

# roadmap

Things to do to complete this exercise:
- ❌ color picker
- ✅ a way to clear the toy's screen
- ❌ random colors
- ✅ screen resolution (grid size)

And some personal things I want to add, but not promised:
- ❌ `"mousedrag"` must be able to draw too
- ❌ a filling tool
- ❌ different brush sizes and shapes
- ❌ a fake dynamic shadow using the mouse position on the window
- ❌ replacing the toy's html+css with images for better performance (too much box-shadows)
- ❌ save/load system
- ❌ zoom levels for the screen
- ❌ toggle button to change toy's visibility
- ❌ frame by frame animation


# How it's going

## Update 1
It's working now! Still needs more work, but I managed to make it show a screen with "pixels" that change color to black once clicked. I'm surprised how I managed to do it, I barely had to search for a few DOM methods. Now it's time to make it more interesting.

## update 2
now it's possible to restart the toy's screen. Screen resolution can also be adjusted.
